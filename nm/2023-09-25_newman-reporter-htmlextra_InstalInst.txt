The reporter works as a plugin with Newman so ensure that you have already installed that package globally, using:
npm install -g newman.

To globally install the htmlextra package:
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra

To use htmlextra as a library, install the package as a dependency into a nodejs project's package.json file using:
npm install -S newman-reporter-htmlextra

To install node, newman and the htmlextra packages together, use this command to pull the Docker image:
docker pull dannydainton/htmlextra
